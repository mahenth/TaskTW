# Teacher Portal - Student Management System

## Overview
The Teacher Portal is a web application built with Django that allows teachers to manage student records. It provides functionalities to add, view, edit, and delete student entries, as well as an efficient way to upload student data via CSV files. The application also includes search and filter capabilities to easily navigate through student records.

## Features
* **User Authentication:** Secure login and logout for teachers.
* **Student CRUD Operations:**
    * **Add Student:** Easily add new student records with name, subject, and marks.
    * **View Students:** Display a paginated list of all students associated with the logged-in teacher.
    * **Edit Student:** Update existing student details (name, subject, marks).
    * **Delete Student:** Remove student records from the system.
* **CSV Upload:**
    * Upload student data from CSV files.
    * Handles new student additions and updates existing student marks (by adding to the current total).
    * Robust error handling for invalid data (e.g., non-numeric marks) and incorrect CSV headers, skipping problematic rows gracefully.
* **Search & Filter:**
    * Search students by name.
    * Filter students by subject.
* **Responsive UI:** Modern and clean user interface built with HTML, CSS (Poppins font, Font Awesome icons), and plain JavaScript for dynamic interactions.
* **User Association:** Each student record is associated with the teacher who created it, ensuring data separation.

## Technologies Used
* **Backend:**
    * Python 3.x
    * Django (Web Framework)
    * `csv` module (for CSV parsing)
* **Frontend:**
    * HTML5
    * CSS3 (Custom styling, Poppins font via Google Fonts, Font Awesome for icons)
    * JavaScript (Vanilla JS for AJAX requests, modal interactions, notifications, search/filter)
* **Database:**
    * SQLite (default for development)
    * PostgreSQL / MySQL (can be configured for production, requires respective database drivers like `psycopg2-binary` or `mysqlclient`)
* **Dependency Management:** `pip` and `requirements.txt`

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x installed
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone <repository_url_here>
cd teacher_portal_project
(Replace <repository_url_here> with the actual URL of your Git repository)

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Bash

python -m venv venv
On Windows:

Bash

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using pip and the requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt yet, create one by running:

Bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Then review the file and remove any unnecessary packages if generated by pip freeze.
Ensure Django is listed in your requirements.txt.

4. Database Setup
Apply migrations to create the necessary database tables.

Bash

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
5. Create a Superuser (Admin Account)
You'll need an admin account to log in and manage the application.

Bash

python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create your username, email, and password.

6. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server.

Bash

python manage.py runserver
The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Usage
Logging In
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You will be redirected to the login page.

Use the superuser credentials you created to log in.

Managing Students (Home Page)
After logging in, you will be redirected to the home page (/home/).

Add Student: Click the "Add" button to open a modal and enter student details.

Edit Student: Click the "Edit" button next to a student record to open a modal pre-filled with their details. Update and save.

Delete Student: Click the "Delete" button next to a student record to remove it.

Search: Use the search bar to find students by name.

Filter: Use the subject dropdown to filter students by subject.

Uploading CSV Files (Manual Integration)
Currently, the UploadCSVView is defined but not directly linked in urls.py in the provided urls.py snippet.

To enable CSV upload via a direct URL: Add the following line to teacher_portal_project/urls.py within the urlpatterns list:

Python

# in teacher_portal_project/urls.py
from .views import UploadCSVView # Make sure to import it
# ...
urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing paths ...
    path('upload-csv/', UploadCSVView.as_view(), name='upload_csv'),
]
Then, you can access the upload page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload-csv/ after logging in.

CSV Format: Your CSV file should have the following headers: name, subject, marks.

Code snippet

name,subject,marks
Alice,Math,85
Bob,Physics,70
Charlie,Chemistry,90
Behavior:

If a student with the same name and subject exists, their marks will be added to their current score.

If a student does not exist, a new record will be created.

Rows with invalid marks (e.g., "not_a_number") or missing name/subject/marks keys will be skipped.

Logging Out
Click the "Logout" link on the home page.
